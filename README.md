# English and IT Sentence Builder Project

Welcome to the English and IT Sentence Builder Project! This interactive platform emerged from the vibrant Discord community called "English and IT," where language enthusiasts and computer science aficionados gather to share knowledge and learn from one another. Despite the majority being Hungarian speakers, the community primarily communicates in English, fostering a diverse and inclusive environment.

## Project Idea and Purpose

Our project centers around enhancing language skills and fostering creativity. We've developed an innovative feature: draggable English words that users can arrange into sentences by placing them within designated boxes. This dynamic interface allows you to construct sentences effortlessly. The primary objective is to encourage members to practice constructing meaningful English sentences while having fun.

## How It Works

1. **Drag and Drop Words:** Utilize the intuitive drag-and-drop functionality to arrange English words in the correct order within designated boxes.
2. **Create Sentences:** Construct sentences by placing words logically, forming coherent and grammatically correct English sentences.
3. **Future Enhancement:** In the future, the platform will include a feature to evaluate the constructed sentences, providing feedback on their accuracy and coherence.
